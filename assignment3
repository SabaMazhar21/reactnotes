What is JSX ?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. Although there are other ways to write components,
most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it.Each React component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup 
that React renders into the browser. React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter 
and can display dynamic information. The best way to understand this is to convert some HTML markup to JSX markup.

The Rules of JSX -
1).Return a single root element .To return multiple elements from a component, wrap them with a single parent tag.If you don’t want to add an extra <div> to your markup,
you can write <> and </> instead.This empty tag is called a Fragment. Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.(JSX looks like HTML, 
but under the hood it is transformed into plain JavaScript objects. You can’t return two objects from a function without wrapping them into an array. This explains why you also 
can’t return two JSX tags without wrapping them into another tag or a Fragment.)

2) Close all the tags : JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like <img> must become <img />.


{TitleComponent} -  Any JavaScript Code .
{<TitleComponent/>} - JS functions and react components are called here.
