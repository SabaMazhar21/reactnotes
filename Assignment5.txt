What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * as export?
  -In JavaScript module facilitates the “export”, of variables, functions, or classes from one module to another. This system primarily offers two approaches for exporting, Named Exports and Default Exports.
   Named exports to allow multiple values to be exported from a module with specific names, while default exports are used for single value or module export, allowing flexibility in import naming conventions.
   When importing named exports, you enclose the names in curly braces {} and use the exact names specified during export.

   Default exports in JavaScript allow a module to export a single value or entity as the default export. Unlike named exports, which allow you to export multiple values from a module, default exports allow you
   to export only one value per module.When importing the default export, you don’t need to use curly braces {}. Instead, you can specify any name for the imported value.
